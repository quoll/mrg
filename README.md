MRG is a lightweight graph API that is useful for accessing general RDF data programmatically,
without the need for a query engine. It started out in several private RDF projects, and was
initially released as open source code as a part of SCON (Java SPARQL Connectivity), but its
utility grew enough to support its own project.

The code samples shown here are current with the latest codebase. In some cases this may lead
the release version.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/quoll/mrg/wiki) for details.
