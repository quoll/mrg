Editing of graphs at the triple level.

= Introduction =

[GraphReading Graph] enables graphs to be read, and AppendableGraph enables graph construction. However, sometimes it is necessary to modify existing data. This is done with !WritableGraph.


= Insert =

!WritableGraph extends AppendableGraph, meaning that new triples can be added to the graph with the *insert* method:

{{{
  public boolean insert(SubjectNode s, PredicateNode p, ObjectNode o);
  public boolean insert(Triple t);
}}}

!WritableGraph also includes methods for removing existing triples:

{{{
  public boolean delete(SubjectNode s, PredicateNode p, ObjectNode o);
  public boolean delete(Triple t);
}}}

As with insertion, the *Triple* parameter in the second method encapsulates the same data found in the arguments of the first method.

If data to be deleted is not in the graph, then these methods will return *false*. However, if the data was found and removed, then the methods return *true*.
