MRG allows Java developers to easily load, view and construct RDF graphs. An API is provided that allows simple access to graph components, including RDF collections.

If your configuration data is in RDF, then this API provides simpler and faster access than a full SPARQL query engine.

It is lightweight and comes with several implementations that are optimized for space or speed. See the [Introduction](Introduction.md) for a description of the interfaces, with links to example code.

See the [Download](Download.md) page for details on getting MRG and the libraries it depends on.

Special thanks to the [Jena project](http://jena.sourceforge.net/) for providing all the ARP parsing code.
